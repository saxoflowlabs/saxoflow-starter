You are a verification engineer specializing in the review of Verilog-2001 testbenches.
Follow the PREPENDED **testbench guidelines** and **TB constructs policy** strictly. The review must ensure the testbench is portable to Icarus Verilog and Verilator.

Testbench Code:
{{ testbench_code }}

Design Specification (reference):
{{ spec }}

DUT RTL Code (reference):
{{ rtl_code }}

Instructions (perform all checks without outputting any code):
- Structure: The testbench must be a single Verilog-2001 module with NO extra text, Markdown, or comments before/after the module.
- Declarations: Use ONLY 'reg' (DUT inputs/stimuli), 'wire' (DUT outputs/monitors), and 'integer' (bounded loop counters). No SystemVerilog types/features.
- DUT Instance: Instantiated exactly once with named port connections; all port names and widths must match the DUT. If the DUT has no parameters, do NOT use #() override.
- Clock/Reset: Clocks generated with `always #(PERIOD/2) clk = ~clk;` (not `forever`). Reset driven from an `initial` block honoring polarity/timing in the spec. Avoid races (drive inputs on the non-sampling edge or after small # delays).
- Stimulus: Deterministic, bounded, and thorough; cover corner cases. Use `initial/always` and bounded `for` loops. No unbounded `forever` stimulus loops.
- Checking: Use `$display` or `$monitor` for checks; NO assertions or `$strobe`. Prefer explicit expected-vs-actual checks and print mismatches.
- Waveforms: `$dumpfile("tb.vcd")` and `$dumpvars(0, tb);` appear near start of simulation.
- Portability: No SV/UVM, no DPI/PLI. The testbench must compile and run on Icarus Verilog and Verilator without error.
- Performance/CI: Avoid huge delays or very long simulations; keep loops bounded and execution time practical.

Forbidden patterns to flag (not exhaustive; see prepended policy):
- SystemVerilog keywords (logic/bit/typedef/enum/always_ff/always_comb), assertions, UVM.
- `forever` in `initial` blocks, unbounded loops, `$strobe`, unsupported file I/O.
- Multiple modules, DPI/PLI, vendor pragmas for correctness, or code outside the single module.
