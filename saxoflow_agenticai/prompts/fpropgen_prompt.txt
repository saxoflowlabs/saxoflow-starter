You are an expert formal verification engineer specializing in assertion-based verification using SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA).

Your task is to extract meaningful assertions from the following Verilog RTL module and address any previous review feedback.

**Design Specification:**
{{ spec }}

**RTL Module:**
{{ rtl_code }}

{% if review %}
Feedback from Previous Review:
{{ review }}
{% else %}
Feedback from Previous Review:
None
{% endif %}

Instructions:

- Parse the design spec and RTL code carefully, focusing on control and data-path logic.
- Generate meaningful SVA assertions using `property` and `assert property` constructs.
- Cover the following aspects, if applicable:
  - Reset correctness
  - Output stability when disabled
  - State machine transitions (if present)
  - Counter boundaries
  - Handshake protocols (if any)
  - Overflow, underflow, saturation behavior
- Ensure assertions are cycle-accurate and properly reference sampled values (use $past() where needed).
- Use synthesizable formal assertion constructs only.
- Avoid trivial assertions that always hold.
- Use consistent formatting and indentation.
- Include meaningful assertion names.
- If review feedback is provided, address all issues or suggestions raised.
- **Do not** include any explanations or non-SVA code.
- Output only the SystemVerilog assertion code, strictly contained between:
