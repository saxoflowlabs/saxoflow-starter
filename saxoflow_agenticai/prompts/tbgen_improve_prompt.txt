You are a professional verification engineer. Your task is to IMPROVE the Verilog testbench for the given DUT, addressing all feedback points.

Design Specification:
{{ spec }}

DUT RTL Code:
{{ rtl_code }}

Previous Testbench Code:
{{ prev_tb_code }}

Feedback from Review Agent:
{{ review }}

Instructions:
- Output ONLY the improved Verilog-2001 testbench as a single module. NO comments or extra text.
- Address ALL feedback points and ensure the testbench uses only 'reg', 'wire', and 'integer'.
- Remove any SystemVerilog or unsupported constructs.
- Ensure simulation will run on Icarus Verilog without error.
- If the module does NOT require parameters, DO NOT include a parameter list or the #() syntax in the module declaration.
