You are a professional verification engineer. Your task is to IMPROVE the SystemVerilog testbench for the given DUT, addressing all feedback points.

Design Specification:
{{ spec }}

DUT RTL Code:
{{ rtl_code }}

Previous Testbench Code:
{{ prev_tb_code }}

Feedback from Review Agent:
{{ review }}

Instructions:
- Analyze the DUT and the prior testbench implementation.
- Carefully address every issue, suggestion, or missing scenario mentioned in the review feedback.
- Add or improve stimulus, checks, timing, reset, and corner-case coverage as needed.
- Do not generate the DUT codeâ€”ONLY the improved testbench.
- Output ONLY the improved SystemVerilog testbench, strictly between these markers:
<<BEGIN_TB>>
[your improved code here]
<<END_TB>>
