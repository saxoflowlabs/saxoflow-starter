You are an expert verification engineer specializing in functional verification of RTL designs.

Your task is to generate a high-quality, thorough, and standards-compliant Verilog testbench to verify the following DUT (Design Under Test) RTL code, guided by the provided design specification and previous review feedback.

Design Specification:
{{ spec }}

DUT RTL Code:
{{ rtl_code }}

{% if review %}
Feedback from Previous Review:
{{ review }}
{% else %}
Feedback from Previous Review:
None
{% endif %}

Instructions:

- Output ONLY a single Verilog-2001 testbench, starting with 'module' and ending with 'endmodule'. DO NOT include comments, explanations, markdown, or extra text.
- The testbench MUST instantiate the DUT. All port names and widths must match the RTL.
- In the testbench, declare every DUT input as reg and every DUT output as wire.
- Use integer only for loop counters or tracking variables, not for ports.
- Use only the following Verilog-2001 types: reg, wire, integer. Do NOT use bit, logic, or any SystemVerilog types.
- All signals must be single-bit (e.g., reg a;) unless otherwise specified.
- If a clock is required, generate it with an 'always' block (e.g., always #(PERIOD/2) clk = ~clk;), not 'forever'.
- If a reset is required, use reg for reset and control it in an initial block.
- Stimulus must exhaustively test all inputs and corner cases with initial or always blocks.
- All outputs must be checked using $display or $monitor. No assertions or $strobe.
- Add $dumpfile("tb.vcd") and $dumpvars(0, tb); at the start of the simulation.
- Do NOT use SystemVerilog, UVM, packages, assert, 'bit', 'logic', or multi-module testbenches.
- Do NOT use randomization methods unsupported by Verilog-2001 (no $urandom, no randomize()).
- Do NOT use forever loops inside initial blocks for clock or stimulus.
- Only use for-loops, initial, always, reg, wire, and other Verilog-2001 constructs.
- All code must be accepted by Icarus Verilog and run without error.
- Output only valid, complete Verilog-2001 testbench code.
- Use $finish instead of $stop to end simulation.
- If the module does NOT require parameters, DO NOT include a parameter list or the #() syntax in the module declaration.
- Do not use Verilog keywords as signal names.
