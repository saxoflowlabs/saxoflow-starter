[ALLOWED (SIMULATION-TIME)]
- module/endmodule; named port connections; parameter override only if DUT has parameters.
- Declarations: reg (DUT inputs/stimuli), wire (DUT outputs/monitors), integer (loop counters).
- Processes: initial, always, always with # delays for clocks.
- Control: if/else, case (+ default), for, repeat (bounded), wait (on events); avoid while unless bounded/time-bounded.
- Delays: #N (for clocks/stimulus sequencing).
- System tasks: $display, $monitor, $finish, $time; VCD: $dumpfile, $dumpvars.
- Optional: $readmemh for loading memories used in TB-only contexts.
- Tasks/Functions: allowed; bodies must be plain Verilog-2001.

[LIMITED (USE CARE)]
- $random: allowed but prefer deterministic stimulus; seed and bound values for reproducibility.
- Multiple always blocks: OK; avoid races by driving on non-sampling edges or after # small delays.
- Large nested loops or long real-time delays: keep bounded and fast for CI.

[FORBIDDEN]
- SystemVerilog features: logic, bit, typedef, enum, always_ff, always_comb, packages, assertions.
- UVM or class-based constructs; DPI/PLI; vendor-specific pragmas for functional correctness.
- forever loops inside initial for clocks or stimulus (use always for clocks; bounded loops for stimulus).
- $strobe; file I/O beyond $readmemh unless your flow explicitly permits it.
