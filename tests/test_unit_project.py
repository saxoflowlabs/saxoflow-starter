"""
Tests for saxoflow.unit_project: project scaffolding.

The `unit` command builds an extensive directory tree and populates it
with templates.  These tests validate that the required folders and
files are created, the synthesis script template contains a known
header, and that invoking the command on an existing directory
aborts gracefully.
