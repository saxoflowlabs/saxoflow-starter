## **Specification: Mealy Machine Finite State Machine (FSM)**

### **Purpose**

This document specifies the behavioral requirements for a synchronous finite state machine (FSM) that follows the Mealy model. The FSM is designed to process a sequence of binary input signals and produce binary outputs based on its current state and current input.

---

### **1. Inputs and Outputs**

* **Inputs:**

  * `clk`: System clock signal (active on rising edge)
  * `reset`: Asynchronous or synchronous reset signal (active high)
  * `in`: Single-bit binary input signal

* **Outputs:**

  * `out`: Single-bit binary output signal

---

### **2. General Behavioral Description**

* The FSM operates synchronously with the system clock.
* Upon activation of the reset signal, the FSM enters its initial (reset) state.
* At each rising edge of the clock, the FSM:

  * Determines the next state based on the present state and the current value of the input (`in`).
  * Simultaneously determines the output (`out`) based on the present state and the current value of the input (`in`).
    (i.e., output is a function of both the current state and input, as per Mealy model.)

---

### **3. State Definition**

* The FSM shall have a finite, well-defined set of named states.
* The initial state is entered after reset.

---

### **4. State Transition Function**

* On each clock cycle, the FSM evaluates a **transition function**:

  * **Next State** = f(Current State, Input)
* All possible combinations of current state and input must be defined in the transition function.

---

### **5. Output Function**

* On each clock cycle, the FSM computes the output as:

  * **Output** = g(Current State, Input)
* The output may change immediately in response to changes in input, even between clock cycles (if the input changes, the output may change on the same clock edge).

---

### **6. Functional Requirements (Example)**

> *(You may replace this with application-specific requirements; below is a generic pattern detector example)*

* **Example**: The FSM detects the binary sequence “101” on the input stream. When the sequence is detected, the output `out` is asserted high (`1`) for one clock cycle.
* At all other times, `out` remains low (`0`).

---

### **7. Constraints**

* All states and outputs must be deterministic for each clock cycle, given the present state and input.
* The FSM must recover and continue operating correctly after reset or after any valid sequence of inputs.

---

### **8. Timing**

* All state transitions and output updates are synchronized to the rising edge of the clock.
* Reset must immediately return the FSM to its initial state and default output.

---

### **9. Power-on and Fault Tolerance**

* On power-on (with reset asserted), the FSM shall always begin operation from its initial state.
* No undefined or illegal states shall be entered under any input condition.

---

### **10. Deliverables**

* State transition diagram/table
* Input/output signal definitions
* Test cases covering all state transitions and outputs

---

**Note:**
This specification describes the observable behavior and requirements for a Mealy model FSM. The actual implementation architecture, coding style, or hardware language is not covered by this document.
