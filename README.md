# 🧰 SaxoFlow: Beginner-Friendly RTL Development Flow

**SaxoFlow** is a modular, CLI-driven open-source environment for simulating, verifying, synthesizing, and implementing digital hardware—designed for students, self-learners, and aspiring digital designers.
It streamlines **FPGA and ASIC flows** with pre-integrated open-source tools, unified setup, and robust diagnostics.

---

## 🌟 Why SaxoFlow?

> “Learning Verilog shouldn’t require mastering 10 tools just to simulate a simple AND gate.”

**SaxoFlow lets you:**

* 🧱 Interactively choose toolchains (FPGA, ASIC, simulation, IDE, and AI/agentic flows)
* 🔧 Use a unified CLI for simulation, synthesis, waveform viewing, formal verification, and implementation
* 🧠 Work smoothly on Linux or WSL
* 🖋 Seamlessly integrate with VSCode
* 🤖 Future-proof your setup for AI-based flows (LLMs, agentic AI)
* 📦 Organize all your hardware projects with a standardized directory layout

## 🚀 Quickstart Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saxoflowlabs/saxoflow-starter.git
cd saxoflow-starter
```

### 2️⃣ Bootstrap the Python Environment

```bash
python3 bootstrap.py
```

This sets up a virtual environment and installs all Python dependencies.

### 3️⃣ Activate the Environment

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 4️⃣ Launch Interactive Environment Setup

Use the interactive preset system to select your flow:

```bash
saxoflow init-env
```

**Presets available:**

* `fpga`     → Minimal FPGA toolchain (simulation, synthesis, PnR)
* `asic`     → Digital ASIC flow (synthesis, PnR, layout, DRC)
* `formal` → Formal verification-centric tools
* `minimal` → Smallest environment for learning/basic simulation
* `agentic-ai` → (Optional) Experimental LLM/AI workflow integration

**Example usage:**

```bash
# Launch with a specific preset:
saxoflow init-env --preset fpga
# For agentic AI features:
saxoflow init-env --preset agentic-ai
```

### 5️⃣ Install Tools

```bash
# Install all selected tools:
saxoflow install all

# Or install individual tools:
saxoflow install verilator
saxoflow install openroad
```

## 🩺 Diagnosing Your Setup

SaxoFlow has a built-in doctor for environment health checks and repair:

* **Full System Check:**

  ```bash
  saxoflow doctor summary
  ```

* **Auto-Repair Missing Tools:**

  ```bash
  saxoflow doctor repair
  ```

* **Environment Info:**

  ```bash
  saxoflow doctor env
  ```

* **Interactive Repair (choose what to fix):**

  ```bash
  saxoflow doctor repair-interactive
  ```

* **Export Diagnostic Log:**

  ```bash
  saxoflow doctor summary --export
  ```

## 🛠️ How SaxoFlow Works

* **Project initialization:** Guides you interactively to select the tools and workflows you need for your target flow.
* **Tool installation:** Uses recipes or system packages to fetch, build, and install tools in a user-local, non-intrusive way.
* **Health checking:** Runs diagnostics to ensure everything (PATH, tools, extensions) is correctly configured and gives actionable tips.
* **Unified workflow:** Supports all major open-source EDA tools for simulation, synthesis, waveform viewing, place-and-route, and formal verification.
* **AI/Agentic Integration:** Optional flows for AI-based hardware design or verification.

## 🤖 Agentic AI Integration (Experimental)

SaxoFlow now includes an experimental agentic AI flow that can automate digital IC design and verification. The agentic AI flow is powered by a multi-agent pipeline, with each agent responsible for a specific stage of the design process.

To use the agentic AI flow, you can use the `saxoflow agenticai` command. For example, to run the full design and verification flow, you can use the following command:

```bash
saxoflow agenticai fullpipeline -i input/spec/alu_spec.md --iters 2
```

For more information on the available commands, you can use the `--help` flag:

```bash
saxoflow agenticai --help
```
